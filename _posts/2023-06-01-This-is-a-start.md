This is my very first venture into programming. I don't have any friends or family that 'program' or 'code' (is there a difference? I still dont know..)
I am a completely blank canvas, apart from doing some very basic HTML in high school for Info Tech classes, which is now pushing 15 years ago.

I'm not sure where to start off on this journey and I think I have a bad case of option paralysis.
The sheer amount of languages available to learn is a little intimidating, and not knowing what each of them specifically do or are used for isn't helping my cause.

From limited research, python seems to be very popular at the moment, and is capable over a range of applications with a reasonable learning curve for a beginner.

I have watched an hour or so of Harvard's CS50 course which I have found on YouTube through recommendations from b and v-loggers alike.
I am hoping to gain some solid basic understandings and fundamentals in computer science from this as a base to build upon.

I've just amde this page using github pages and 'Jekyll', which I'm not entirely sure on how it works, but if this page loads I guess I followed the tutorial closely enough.

Time will tell.
Wish me luck!
