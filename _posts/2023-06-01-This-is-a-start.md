This is my very first venture into programming.  

I've decided I would like to learn how to 'program' or 'code' (is there a difference? I still dont know..)  
I am almost a completely blank canvas, apart from doing some very basic HTML in high school for Info-Tech classes, which is now pushing 15 years ago, and some *very* basic arduino.

*So maybe a blank canvas with a little bit of old crusty paint on it?*

I'm not sure where to start off on this journey, but I definitely have a bad case of option paralysis...  

The sheer amount of languages available to learn is a little overwhelming, and not knowing what each of them specifically do or are used for isn't helping.

From limited research, python seems to be very popular at the moment, and is capable over a range of applications with a reasonable learning curve for a **beginner**.

>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with a simple syntax, which makes it easily readable and extremely user- and beginner-friendly. Originally built to satisfy Guido Van Rossumâ€™s desire for a programming language that was simple to use and beautiful to look at, Python was first released to the world in 1991.

I have watched an hour or so of Harvard's CS50 course which I have found on YouTube through recommendations from b and v-loggers alike.  
I am hoping to gain some solid basic understandings and fundamentals in computer science from this as a base to build upon.

I've just made this page using github pages and 'Jekyll', which I'm not entirely sure about how it works, but if this page loads I guess I followed the tutorial closely enough.

Time will tell.

Wish me luck!

# UPDATE:

This [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) has been really helpful as a beginner.  
Using the material available on there, I have been able to insert some images, create line breaks, add empahsis to some text, and even put in a sexy little "block quote".
